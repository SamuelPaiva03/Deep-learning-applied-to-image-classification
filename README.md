# Deep-learning-applied-to-image-classification
A convolutional (trained) deep learning network is applied to the classification of patterns in images.
The database considered is CIFAR-10.
This database consists of 60 thousand color images of 32x32 pixels, with 50 thousand for training and 10 thousand for testing.
The images are divided into 10 classes, namely: airplane, ship, truck, automobile, frog, bird, dog, cat, horse and deer.
Each image has only one of the objects of the interest class, which may be partially obstructed by other objects that do not belong to this set.
